# django-unsaved-changes

#Features / Settings

1. UNSAVED_CHANGES_UNSAVED_CHANGES_ALERT :: Alert admin when they are about to 
	close a window that has unsaved changes. 
![Unload Notification](https://raw.github.com/ninapavlich/django-unsaved-changes/master/docs/screenshots/unload_notification.png)

2. UNSAVED_CHANGES_SUBMITTED_OVERLAY ::  Display an overlay indicating that 
	the form has been submitted and is processing. This feature is in response 
	to many admins that I've worked with that were unsure that the form was 
	being submitted and so submitted it multiple times. 
![Saving Overlay](https://raw.github.com/ninapavlich/django-unsaved-changes/master/docs/screenshots/saving_overlay.png)

3. UNSAVED_CHANGES_SUMBITTED_ALERT :: Alert admin when they are trying to 
	navigate away from the window after hitting the submit button.

4. UNSAVED_CHANGES_UNSAVED_CHANGES_VISUALS :: Show a visual indication when 
	a field has been modified.

5. UNSAVED_CHANGES_PERSISTANT_STORAGE :: Restore changed field values if 
	window is accidentally closed. This feature uses garlic.js
	This feature is not quite production ready, since some widgets only update
	the input field when the form is submitted and so this may not work as 
	expected. 
![Garlic Notification](https://raw.github.com/ninapavlich/django-unsaved-changes/master/docs/screenshots/garlic_notification.png)


You can use any combination of these three features using the settings below, 
though at this point I don't recommend using the 
UNSAVED_CHANGES_PERSISTANT_STORAGE feature on forms that use complex widgets.


#Compatibility / Requirements

1. Django (last tested with 1.10.4)
2. django-grappelli (last tested with 2.7.1)
3. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE9+ (TODO -- verify)

#Installation

    pip install django-unsaved-changes

##settings.py

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
      ...  
      'django_unsaved_changes',    
      ...
    )

	UNSAVED_CHANGES_UNSAVED_CHANGES_ALERT = True
	UNSAVED_CHANGES_SUMBITTED_ALERT = True
	UNSAVED_CHANGES_SUBMITTED_OVERLAY = True
	UNSAVED_CHANGES_UNSAVED_CHANGES_VISUALS = True
	UNSAVED_CHANGES_PERSISTANT_STORAGE = False #not quite production ready

	#Note that all four of these settins are False by default

##admin.py
  
Either extend the example admin:

	from django_unsaved_changes.admin import UnsavedChangesAdmin


	class MyModelAdmin(UnsavedChangesAdmin):

		#Note: You may override settings on an individual admin view:
		# UNSAVED_CHANGES_UNSAVED_CHANGES_ALERT = False
		# UNSAVED_CHANGES_SUMBITTED_ALERT = False
		# UNSAVED_CHANGES_SUBMITTED_OVERLAY = False
		# UNSAVED_CHANGES_UNSAVED_CHANGES_VISUALS = False
		# UNSAVED_CHANGES_PERSISTANT_STORAGE = False

Or simply add the necessary template and context variables to your existing admin view:
	
	class MyModelAdmin(UnsavedChangesAdmin):

		change_form_template = "admin/django_unsaved_changes/change_form.html"
 		
 		def change_view(self, request, object_id, form_url='', extra_context=None):
        
	        extra_context = extra_context or {}
	        extra_context['UNSAVED_CHANGES_UNSAVED_CHANGES_ALERT'] = True
	        extra_context['UNSAVED_CHANGES_SUMBITTED_ALERT'] = True
	        extra_context['UNSAVED_CHANGES_SUBMITTED_OVERLAY'] = True
	        extra_context['UNSAVED_CHANGES_UNSAVED_CHANGES_VISUALS'] = True
	        extra_context['UNSAVED_CHANGES_PERSISTANT_STORAGE'] = False
	        return super(MyModelAdmin, self).change_view(request, object_id, form_url, extra_context)
